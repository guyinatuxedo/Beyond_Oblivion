# pogreb

So this is some documentation regarding the `pogreb`, which is from `https://github.com/akrylysov/pogreb`. This documentation was made on the latest version, at `03/22/2022`.

So `pogreb` is a databasing API, that you call from go code you write. Below you will find docs, that either are related to the functionallity of that database, or just exploit POCs. Current;y I have a POC for leaking data wiht a database query.
